# Parametric Bevel Gears

This was originally posted on Thingiverse on March 29th, 2010. Since
then, Thingiverse has made some controversial changes to its Terms of
Service. It's written for [OpenSCAD][] and the resulting models are
intended to be printed on a 3D printer.

This code hasn't been touched. I don't even know whether this code
still even works with OpenSCAD, to be honest. Reproduced below are the
original instructions and description.

## Original Description

I need some bevel gears, so I made an openSCAD script to make them! A
lot of the parameters here are inspired by Catarina/'s spur gear
script, but it would have been harder to make if I had started with
hers, so I made this one from scratch.

It can do:

* bevel gears
* combination rome/bevel gears
* triangular teeth
* center holes
* plain spur gears, if you really want

The STLs are just for show; they probably do not work with each
other. Use openSCAD to make your own STLs! Thingiverse rendered the
first stl weird... if you were wondering, it is completely
solid. there are not actually red and blue lines piercing the gear.

edited: gear teeth can now be triangular or fractionally triangular

## Required Tools

* 3D Printer.
